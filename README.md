An Stackless Actor-Model game server engine for those who enjoy Python and life-time saved by it.

Why:
  Threading is complecated.  
  Normal Python is too slow to be in lower level. So we have C/Lua/Python combination.  
  But game scripting with Python is lovely.  
  What if we do a fast game engine with Stackless-Python infrastructures?
